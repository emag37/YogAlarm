#YogAlarm - ESP32 Based Remote Thermometer and Alarm

This is a simple project that turns a cheap ESP32-based TTGO dev board
and DS18B20 temperature sensor into a web-based thermometer with alarm
function. It was designed to signal when milk has cooled to a specific
temperature for yogurt-making, but could also be used for other 
realtime temperature monitoring applications.

##Compiling

WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD must be defined in main.cpp prior to compilation.
Other than that, it should work out-of-the-box with PlatformIO. AUDIO_GPIO_PIN
set the pin for the speaker, and TEMP_SENSOR_GPIO_PIN sets the data pin for
the DS18B20.

##Using

The ESP32 should automatically connect to the WiFi AP defined with WIFI_SSID and
WIFI_PASSWORD. You can then access it with mDns at http://yogalarm.local. Once set,
the low and high temperature thresholds will cause a beep to be played on the
speaker if they are crossed.
